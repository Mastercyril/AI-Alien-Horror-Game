---

## 🚧 Current Blockers

### 1. VIVERSE Points Limitation
**Issue:** Cannot generate remaining 31 3D objects  
**Required:** VIVERSE points for Object AI generation  
**Solutions:**
- Complete VIVERSE missions to earn points
- Purchase VIVERSE points
- Use alternative 3D modeling tools

**Impact:** Medium - blocks Phase 4 completion but documentation is ready

### 2. Unity Script Import
**Issue:** Scripts need to be manually imported from Gemini  
**Required:** Access to Unity Editor desktop application  
**Solutions:**
- Download Unity Hub and Unity 2021 LTS/2022 LTS
- Access Gemini conversation to copy scripts
- Create folder structure and import files

**Impact:** Medium - can be done when Unity is available

### 3. API Keys Configuration
**Issue:** Need production API keys for Gemini integration  
**Required:** Gemini API key with billing enabled  
**Solutions:**
- Set up Google Cloud project
- Enable Gemini API
- Configure billing

**Impact:** Low - needed for Phase 6 (AI Integration)

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Generate 3D Assets (When Points Available)
1. Obtain VIVERSE points
2. Open 3D_OBJECT_PROMPTS.md
3. Generate all 32 objects systematically
4. Download GLB/FBX files
5. Organize by location folders

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours (with points)  
**Prerequisites:** VIVERSE points

### Priority 2: Import Unity Scripts
1. Install Unity 2021 LTS or 2022 LTS
2. Open Unity Cloud project
3. Access Gemini conversation
4. Create folder structure:
   ```
   Assets/
   ├── Scripts/
   │   ├── AI/
   │   ├── Core/
   │   ├── NPC/
   │   ├── UI/

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What Worked Well:
1. **Documentation First Approach** - Having comprehensive docs makes development clear
2. **AI Tool Integration** - Gemini, VIVERSE Object AI work seamlessly together
3. **GitHub Organization** - All files logically structured and version controlled
4. **Modular Planning** - Breaking into 8 phases makes large project manageable

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **VIVERSE Points Limit** - Free tier limits asset generation
2. **Browser-Based Limitations** - Can't directly edit Unity project from browser
3. **Long Processing Times** - Some AI generations take several minutes

### Lessons Learned:
1. Document everything as you go
2. Save AI prompts for reproducibility
3. Use version control for all text-based assets
4. Plan for resource limitations (API limits, generation points)
